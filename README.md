# Text Encoding Initiative Repository

This repository contains the sources for building the [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org) P5 Guidelines and schemas as well as documentation and scripts for setting up the Continuous Integration platform. If you want to work on the Guidelines, you should look in the [P5 directory](./tree/master/P5). Some notes on working with Git may be found in the [Git README](./blob/master/Documents/Git-README.md) document.
