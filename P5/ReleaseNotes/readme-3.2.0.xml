      <p>This release (Codename: xxxx) is the first in some time not to introduce any major new
        changes to the TEI Guidelines. The Council has focused mainly on fixing bugs and on tidying
        up parts of the Guidelines that needed attention. </p>
      <p>
        Highlights of this release include:
        <list>
          <item>As part of this release, the TEI Debian packages will once more be available (<ref
            target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1441">#1441</ref>).</item>
          <item><gi>listRelation</gi> can now be used directly inside <gi>body</gi> (<ref
            target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1552">#1552</ref>).</item>
          <item><gi>lb</gi>, <gi>pb</gi>, and <gi>cb</gi> are now properly glossed as beginings
            rather than as breaks (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1529">#1529</ref>).</item>
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
        </list>
      </p>
      <p>In addition, dozens of wording improvements and corrections of typographic errors have been
        made to the <title>Guidelines</title>.</p>
      <p>Many improvements have been made
        to the XSL stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma and OxGarage as
        well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the
        Guidelines and are at <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets"
          >https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. </p>
