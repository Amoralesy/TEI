      <p>This release (Codename: Sinterklaas) has...
        <list>
          <item><!-- Add more items --></item>
          <item>A new datatype <ident type="datatype">teidata.prefix</ident> has been introduced
          to allow restricting an attribute value to one that could be use as a URI scheme name.</item>
          <item>The <att>ident</att> attribute of <gi>prefixDef</gi>
          is now restricted to the new <ident
          type="datatype">teidata.prefix</ident> datatype. This will
          avoid errors which would occur if a character that is not
          legal as a URI scheme were used as part of this attributeâ€™s
          value.</item>
          <item>Further formal constraints on the <att>output</att>
          and <att>predicate</att> attributes of <gi>model</gi> have
          been added to try to help users avoid ambiguous sets of
          <gi>model</gi>s elements.</item>
          <item>ISO Schematron is now the only flavor of Schematron
          used or supported by the <title>Guidelines</title>.</item>
          <item>The following constructs are now deprecated:
            <list>
              <item>the value <val>isoschematron</val> of
              <att>scheme</att> of <gi>constraintSpec</gi> (use
              <val>schematron</val> instead, as they mean the same
              thing now).</item>
              <item>the default value (<val>false</val>) of <att>defective</att> of <ident type="class">att.msExcerpt</ident></item>
              <item>the default value (<val>unknown</val>) of <att>status</att> of <gi>availability</gi></item>
              <item>the default value (<val>unknown</val>) of <att>status</att> of <gi>correction</gi></item>
              <item>the default value (<val>unknown</val>) of <att>aloud</att> of <gi>said</gi></item>
              <item>the default value (<val>unknown</val>) of <att>discrete</att> of <gi>sound</gi></item>
            </list>
          </item>
          <item>The rules regarding <gi>f</gi>, its <att>fVal</att> attribute and its content have been
          cleaned up to fix a contradiction.</item>
          <item>The <gi>title</gi> element is now a member of <ident type="class">att.datable</ident>.</item>
          <item>The <gi>listBibl</gi> element is now a member of <ident type="class">model.frontPart</ident>.</item>
          <item>A new element called <gi>anyElement</gi>, which permits any XML content in a content model. This removes the last remaining requirement for RELAX NG in content models, allowing us to define TEI entirely in TEI.</item>
          <item>A new element called <gi>dataFacet</gi> for restricting references to W3C datatypes in ODD.</item>
          <item><gi>supplied</gi> is now part of model.choicePart, so it can be used within <gi>choice</gi>.</item>
          <item>A new attribute <att>require</att> has been added to
          <ident type="class">att.textCritical</ident>. It can be used
          to indicate interdependance between variant readings.</item>
          <item>A new Exemplar called <ident>simpleText</ident> has been added. This
          updated version of TEI Lite, developed as part of the 
            <title>TEI Simple</title>  project, makes extensive use of 
            the processing model techniques introduced in a previous release and is fully documented
            by the ODD included in this release.
          </item>
        </list>
      </p>
      <p>In addition, dozens of wording improvements and corrections
      of typographic errors have been made to the <title>Guidelines</title>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, improvements have been made to the XSL
      stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma
      and OxGarage as well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets
      are maintained separately from the Guidelines and are at <ref
      target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>.</p>
      <p><!-- Say something about oXygen release maybe? --></p>
